# Arbiter - Advanced Discord Misinformation Detection Bot

Arbiter is a sophisticated Discord bot designed to combat misinformation through intelligent fact-checking and contradiction detection. The bot monitors Discord channels for potentially false claims, verifies them against authoritative sources, and provides educational responses to users.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Zero False Positives Architecture
- **High Confidence Threshold**: Only flags content when confidence exceeds 80%
- **Multi-Step Verification**: Comprehensive fact-checking pipeline with multiple validation layers
- **Conservative Approach**: Errs on the side of caution to maintain user trust

### Advanced AI-Powered Analysis
- **Claim Extraction**: Identifies verifiable factual statements while filtering out opinions and sarcasm
- **Plausibility Check**: Initial assessment to catch obviously true/false claims
- **Source Verification**: Google Search integration to find authoritative sources
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Compares claims against multiple credible sources
- **Contradiction Detection**: Analyzes user's message history for inconsistencies
- **Confidence Scoring**: Final assessment with rigorous threshold requirements

### Educational Approach
- **Non-Confrontational Responses**: Focuses on media literacy rather than direct contradiction
- **Source Transparency**: Provides links to reliable sources for verification
- **User-Friendly Messaging**: Simple, helpful explanations without technical jargon

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Message Monitoring
The bot continuously monitors Discord channels for messages containing factual claims.

### 2. Claim Analysis Pipeline
When a message is detected, Arbiter runs through this process:

```
Message Input
    ‚Üì
Claim Extraction (filters opinions/sarcasm)
    ‚Üì
Plausibility Check (catches obvious cases)
    ‚Üì
Google Search (finds authoritative sources)
    ‚Üì
Source Analysis (evaluates credibility & consensus)
    ‚Üì
Contradiction Detection (checks user history)
    ‚Üì
Confidence Scoring (>80% threshold required)
    ‚Üì
Educational Response (if flagged)
```

### 3. Response Generation
Only when high confidence is achieved:
- Provides educational information
- Links to authoritative sources
- Suggests further reading
- Maintains respectful tone

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

3. Invite bot to your Discord server with appropriate permissions
4. Bot will start monitoring automatically

## üìä Database Schema

### User Memory
- Personal context and preferences
- Fact-check history
- Conversation summaries

### Channel Memory

4. **International Organizations** (UN, World Bank)
5. **Reputable Reference Sources** (Britannica)

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-False Positive Measures

- **Multiple Verification Steps**: Each claim undergoes 4-5 analysis stages
- **Source Consensus Required**: Multiple sources must agree before flagging
- **Context Awareness**: Considers sarcasm, hypotheticals, and opinions
- **Human-Like Reasoning**: Uses advanced AI to understand nuance
- **Confidence Calibration**: Only acts on very high confidence assessments

## üìà Performance Monitoring
