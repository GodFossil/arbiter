# Basic Logic and Reasoning

## Contradiction

A contradiction occurs when two statements cannot both be true at the same time. If statement A is true, then statement B must be false, and vice versa.

Examples of contradictions:
- "The earth is flat" vs "The earth is round"
- "Vaccines cause autism" vs "Vaccines do not cause autism"
- "It is raining" vs "It is not raining"

## Logical Consistency

Arguments should be internally consistent. When someone makes contradictory statements, they cannot both be correct simultaneously.

## Evidence Standards

Claims require appropriate evidence. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

## Scientific Method

The scientific method involves observation, hypothesis formation, testing, and peer review. Scientific consensus emerges from reproducible results across multiple independent studies.

## Burden of Proof

The person making a positive claim bears the burden of providing evidence for that claim. "Absence of evidence" arguments are generally weak unless comprehensive searching has been done.
